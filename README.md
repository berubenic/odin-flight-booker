# Odin Flight Booker

This is a one-way flight booker.

The first three steps of a typical checkout process for booking a one-way flight:

A typical airline booking flow:

1.  Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
2.  Choose from among a list of eligible flights
3.  Enter passenger information for all passengers
4.  ~~Enter billing information~~

Step 4 would be done via integration of something like Paypal, via a gem or an SDK or Stripe.
